# Cloudflare Pages Functions configuration
# This file configures rate limiting for the API endpoints
#
# Note: For Cloudflare Pages, rate limiting bindings may need to be configured
# through the Cloudflare dashboard. This file is primarily for local development
# with Wrangler. In production, configure the rate limiting binding through:
# Cloudflare Dashboard > Your Pages Project > Settings > Functions > Rate Limiting
#
# Rate limiting for join endpoints: 3 requests per minute per user
[[ratelimits]]
name = "JOIN_RATE_LIMITER"
# An identifier you define, that is unique to your Cloudflare account.
# Must be an integer. Change this to a unique namespace ID for your account.
# Each namespace_id must be unique across your entire Cloudflare account.
# Note: This is NOT a KV namespace ID - it's an arbitrary integer for rate limiting
# Must be a string in TOML format, but represents a positive integer
namespace_id = "1001"
# Limit: 3 requests per 60 seconds (1 minute) per user
# The key used for rate limiting is the authenticated user ID
simple = { limit = 3, period = 60 }
